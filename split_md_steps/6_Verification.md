## Verification

For the final step, we demonstrate how the zero-knowledge proof that was produced by the credential holder is verified. 

The following code will load the proof generated by Sindri's API and ensure the proof artifacts satisfy the [arithmetic relationships](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260.pdf) that underpin zero-knowledge cryptography.
```
cd ../verifier
go run bls-verify credential-proof.json 
```
As long as the verifiable presentation is sound, you should see something like
```
Proof verified successfully.
```
As an exercise, you can try changing characters in `credential-proof.json` to convince yourself how difficult it is to forge a verifiable presentation.

NOTE While this codelab presents a toy example of verifiable credentials for teaching purposes, in production, the zero-knowledge circuit would have proving and verifying keys produced well in advance.  Any verifier would use the universally agreed upon keys for the verification circuit, rather than accepting a verification key from a user.
