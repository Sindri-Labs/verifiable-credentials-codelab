## Congratulations!

You have just used all the necessary tools that underpin a new paradigm of decentralized identity. These powerful standards and cryptographic techniques will enable individuals to have tighter control of their credentials and still broadly participate wherever credentials and identity mechanisms are necessary.

Specifically, you saw how an issuer might sign a digital document and transfer it to the credential holder.  The credential holder, an end user, then applied the readily available infrastructure and software provided by Sindri and GCP to produce a verifiable presentation which they passed to a verifier.  Finally, the verifier was able to substantiate that the holder possessed a valid credential without seeing the signed data firsthand.

### Next Steps
* Learn more about [Zero-knowledge Solutions](https://sindri.app/docs/introduction/) 
* Dive into the [Verifiable Credentials Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)
