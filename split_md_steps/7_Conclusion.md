## Conclusion

Cryptography used to be an esoteric field, but every time a cryptographic concept has been made readily available with an intuitive interface, that concept has revolutionized the digital world, and the way we communicate with each other. Zero knowledge stands to do the same. Any time you are tempted to supply some information to another party, ask yourself "Is it sufficient to merely prove that I have this information, or prove some property of it?" If so, you may wish to convert it to using a ZK proof. This is far more widespread than you might think, and future generations will look back in horror at the way we have all been doxing ourselves just to access basic services.

While the example above is just a toy, it hopefully shows how you can build zero knowlege solutions today, to solve real world problems.
