Sindri provides automated ZK proving infrastructure, empowering teams to launch in minutes instead of months.
Through the Sindri API, developers can seamlessly integrate verifiable computation, reducing time to market, cutting costs, and scaling faster.
Sindri makes zero-knowledge infrastructure simple and accessible, facilitating automation within the most hardware-intensive layer of the ZK app deployment stack.

This repository hosts the Golang code used in the [Qwiklab's tutorial](TBD) on verifiable credentials and zero-knowledge proofs via Sindri and Google Cloud.
In the lab, you will learn:
- What verifiable credentials are and how they differ from traditional credentials
- How issuers produce these digital credentials
- How a verifiable credential is transformed into a verifiable presentation via zero-knowledge proofs
- How to verify the presentation
